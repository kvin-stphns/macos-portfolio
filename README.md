## Welcome to Kevin's Portfolio Website

### About the Project

This portfolio website is a showcase of my work, skills, and interests. It is designed to emulate a macOS terminal, providing a unique and interactive experience for visitors. The website is built using ReactJS and styled-components, and it includes various features such as a dynamic command system, a resume viewer, and links to my social profiles.

### Features

- **Interactive Terminal**: Emulates a macOS terminal with dynamic commands.
- **Resume Viewer**: View my resume directly on the website.
- **Project Showcase**: Links to my projects and profiles on GitHub, LinkedIn, and more.
- **Creative Design**: Styled using styled-components for a modern and clean look.
